"""KG-based plausibility scoring (C plan).

Local plausibility = how likely each (s, p, o) edge in a hypothesis path is,
predicted by a trained KG link predictor.

Global attestation = how often the whole path is jointly mentioned in PubMed.

surprise_gap = local_plausibility - global_attestation. Positive gaps locate
hypotheses where every hop is supported by the KG distribution but the joint
chain has not been written down yet.
