CASE-STUDY OUTPUT CONTRACT — REQUIRED ON EVERY CLAIM:
- `case_study_ids` is a JSON list of unique formal IDs in registry order.
- `case_study_gates` is an object containing exactly these JSON booleans:
  """ + ", ".join(GATE_NAMES) + """.
- `scope_evidence_spans` is a list of short verbatim spans grounded in the supplied
  abstract/full text. Use [] only when `case_study_ids` is [].
- `scope_confidence` is a number in 0..1.
- `scope_decision_basis` concisely explains why the claim does or does not receive
  formal labels. It is required even for a general-only decision.
- `case2_pathway_mediation` is component-based like Case 1: a direct
  genetic/pathway-to-neural claim or a direct baseline-neural-to-later-outcome
  claim is sufficient. It is canonicalized from the corresponding
  imaging_genetics, progression_prediction, or prognosis label.

Entity types (aligned to the 7-atom alphabet — DISEASE / DRUG / IMAGING_MARKER /
GENE_TARGET / COGNITIVE_TASK / OUTCOME / INDIVIDUAL_DATA):
- disease            → DISEASE atom    (e.g. "Alzheimer disease", "schizophrenia")
- drug               → DRUG atom       (e.g. "donepezil", "ketamine", "lithium")
                       Use the INN (international non-proprietary name), NOT brand
                       names: "fluoxetine" not "Prozac"; "haloperidol" not "Haldol".
- brain_region       → IMAGING_MARKER  (e.g. "hippocampus", "dorsolateral prefrontal cortex")
- network            → IMAGING_MARKER  (e.g. "default mode network", "salience network",
                       "frontoparietal network", "ventral attention network")
- biomarker          → IMAGING_MARKER  (e.g. "amyloid SUVR", "cortical thickness", "FA",
                       "ALFF", "ReHo", "functional connectivity strength")
- gene               → GENE_TARGET     HGNC primary symbol (e.g. "APOE", "BDNF",
                       "DRD2", "COMT", "MAPT", "SNCA")
- neurotransmitter   → GENE_TARGET     For receptor / transporter measurements,
                       output the receptor GENE symbol when identifiable:
                       serotonin → "HTR1A"/"HTR1B"/"HTR2A"/"HTR4"/"SLC6A4";
                       dopamine  → "DRD1"/"DRD2"/"SLC6A3";

                       GABA → "GABRA1"; glutamate (mGluR5) → "GRM5"; opioid → "OPRM1";
                       cannabinoid → "CNR1"; histamine → "HRH3"; SV2A → "SV2A".
                       Fall back to neurotransmitter name only if no receptor/transporter
                       is specified.
- protein            → GENE_TARGET     (e.g. "tau protein" → "MAPT", "alpha-synuclein"
                       → "SNCA", "amyloid-beta" → "APP")
- cognitive_function → COGNITIVE_TASK  (e.g. "working memory", "n-back", "Stroop task",
                       "MID task", "go/no-go", "emotional faces")
- rating_scale       → OUTCOME         Established clinical / behavioral rating
                       scales (e.g. "HAM-D", "MMSE", "MDS-UPDRS", "PANSS").
                       Use the OUTCOME:<scale> hint when the scale matches the
                       enum listed below.
- adverse_event      → OUTCOME         Drug / treatment side-effects (e.g.
                       "hepatotoxicity", "akathisia", "tardive dyskinesia",
                       "extrapyramidal symptoms"). LEAVE the hint EMPTY — these
                       are descriptive, not enum entries. Apply the canonical
                       naming discipline (full term, expanded abbreviations).
- clinical_event     → OUTCOME         Clinical events / symptoms / outcomes
                       that are NOT rating scales (e.g. "seizure", "stroke",
                       "encephalopathy", "cerebral edema", "all-cause mortality",
                       "post-surgical outcome", "treatment response").
                       LEAVE the hint EMPTY — descriptive, not enum.
- individual_data    → INDIVIDUAL_DATA Demographic / lifestyle / non-imaging biological
                       individual variables (e.g. "age", "sex", "APOE-ε4 status",
                       "polygenic risk score", "BMI", "blood pressure", "education",
                       "smoking", "diet", "socioeconomic status", "Big Five personality").

subject_canonical_hint / object_canonical_hint (OPTIONAL — fill in when you recognize a
standard ID; otherwise output ""). Do NOT try to guess UMLS CUIs — name-only resolution
will be performed downstream. For the entities below, when you DO know the ID, prefer
these prefix conventions:
- GENE:<HGNC_symbol>       human gene/protein (e.g. "GENE:APOE", "GENE:BDNF", "GENE:HTR2A").
                           Always uppercase HGNC primary symbol — not gene names.
- NN:<id>                  NeuroNames brain region (e.g. "NN:11" for hippocampus).
                           Only use if you are certain of the NN id; otherwise leave empty.
- ATC:<code>               drug ATC code (e.g. "ATC:N06DA02" donepezil,
                           "ATC:N06AB03" fluoxetine, "ATC:N03AX14" levetiracetam).
- OUTCOME:<scale>          ONLY for established rating scales matching this enum.
                           Do NOT use this prefix for adverse events, symptoms, or
                           clinical events — for those, leave the hint "" and rely
                           on descriptive naming. The KG currently knows:
                           OUTCOME:HAM-D / MADRS / BDI / PHQ-9 / HAM-A / GAD-7 / MMSE /
                           MoCA / CDR-SB / NPI / MDS-UPDRS / PDQ-39 / PANSS / BPRS / SANS /
                           YMRS / CGI / GAF / ADHD-RS / ADOS / SRS / ALSFRS-R / EDSS / MSFC /
                           UHDRS / NIHSS / PSQI / ESS / SF-36 / WHODAS / QOLIE-31 / BPI / AE_GI.
- INDIVIDUAL_DATA:<anchor> known anchors: aging, sex, education, body_mass_index,
                           blood_pressure, polygenic_risk_score, socioeconomic_status, diet,
                           big5_openness / big5_conscientiousness / big5_extraversion /
                           big5_agreeableness / big5_neuroticism.
- COGAT_TASK:<id>          Cognitive Atlas task/concept (use only if you recognize the id).
- COGAT_CONCEPT:<id>       Cognitive Atlas cognitive concept.
- COGAT_DISORDER:<id>      Cognitive Atlas disorder.
- ATLAS:<name>             parcellation atlas (DK / Schaefer400 / Aseg / AAL / HO / Dosenbach).

HARD RULE for hints: every hint MUST either be the empty string "" OR start with one of
these exact prefixes followed by a colon: GENE: / NN: / ATC: / OUTCOME: / INDIVIDUAL_DATA:
/ COGAT_TASK: / COGAT_CONCEPT: / COGAT_DISORDER: / ATLAS:. Anything else (e.g. raw
descriptive phrases like "tau pathology", "episodic memory", "schizophrenia") is INVALID
— in those cases leave the hint "" and put the descriptive form into `subject` / `object`
text instead.

For all other entities (especially diseases, brain regions without an NN id, networks,
biomarkers, cognitive functions, individual_data without a known anchor), the hint stays
"" and you instead make the `subject` / `object` text itself as canonical as possible:
- expand abbreviations: "AD" → "Alzheimer disease", "MDD" → "major depressive disorder",
  "DLPFC" → "dorsolateral prefrontal cortex", "DMN" → "default mode network",
  "ACC" → "anterior cingulate cortex", "OFC" → "orbitofrontal cortex".
- use the full standard term, not lab jargon: "polygenic risk score" not "PRS";
  "amyloid-beta 42" not "Aβ42".
- prefer the form a MeSH/UMLS browser would return for that concept.
This descriptive-name discipline is more useful than guessing CUI codes — downstream
ingestion will alias-match these names against the canonical KG.

subject_atlas / object_atlas (OPTIONAL, only for IMAGING_MARKER brain_region entries):
If the abstract EXPLICITLY names the parcellation/atlas the region was measured in,
output one of: "DK", "Schaefer400", "Aseg", "AAL", "HO" (Harvard-Oxford), "Brainnetome",
"Glasser", "Dosenbach", "Power", "Yeo7", "Yeo17".
HARD RULE: if the abstract does NOT explicitly name an atlas (e.g. it just says
"hippocampus" or "default mode network" with no parcellation reference), you MUST
output empty string "". DO NOT infer the atlas from modality, region type, or common
practice. Inference here is a hallucination — leave it blank.
For network-level entries: same rule. "DMN" by itself → "". "DMN as defined by Yeo's
7-network parcellation" → "Yeo7".

Predicates — CLOSED SET. The `predicate` field MUST be one of these exact strings; any
other value is invalid. Pick the MOST SPECIFIC one that fits the abstract's language:

  Causal / mechanistic:  causes, treats, inhibits, activates, increases, reduces, modulates
  Predictive:            is_biomarker_of, is_risk_factor_for, predicts, distinguishes
  Correlational:         correlates_with, mediates
  Drug-target:           binds_to               (drug → receptor / transporter gene)
  Adverse-effect:        has_adverse_effect     (drug → AE / symptom / clinical event)
  Discovery (gene maps): gene_associated_with_disease   (gene → disease, GWAS/DisGeNET)
                         gene_associated_with_anatomy   (gene → brain region)
                         gene_enriched_in_region        (gene → brain region, AHBA)
                         receptor_density_in            (receptor gene → brain region, PET)
  Vague fallback:        is_associated_with     — last-resort ONLY when the abstract
                         itself uses vague language ("X is associated with Y") and no
                         direction or mechanism is reported.

Common verb → canonical-predicate mappings (do NOT emit the left side):
- "induces", "leads to", "produces" → causes
- "ameliorates", "improves", "alleviates" → treats
- "preserves", "protects", "maintains" → treats   (when the protected outcome is a
   clinical / cognitive measure that disease would otherwise worsen)
- "facilitates", "aids" → causes (if mechanistic) OR predicts (if outcome-level)
- "reflects", "indexes" → is_biomarker_of
- "progresses toward", "predicts conversion to" → predicts

CRITICAL: Choose the most precise predicate based on the study design and language:
- RCT / intervention → "treats" or "causes"
- Longitudinal / prospective → "is_risk_factor_for" or "predicts"
- Diagnostic accuracy → "is_biomarker_of" or "distinguishes"
- Molecular mechanism → "activates", "inhibits", "increases", "reduces"
- Cross-sectional correlation → "correlates_with"
- Drug pharmacology / receptor binding → "binds_to" (drug → receptor gene)
- Drug side-effect language ("X causes/induces/leads to Y" where Y is an AE) → "has_adverse_effect"
- GWAS hit / DisGeNET-style gene-disease report → "gene_associated_with_disease"
- AHBA / spatial gene expression → "gene_enriched_in_region"
- PET receptor density mapping → "receptor_density_in"
- If the abstract says "X increases Y" or "X reduces Y", use "increases" or "reduces", NOT "is_associated_with"

Directional measurement comparisons — IMPORTANT:
If a biomarker, imaging measure, cognitive score, receptor binding measure, blood
flow measure, volume, density, activation level, or ratio is reported as increased,
decreased, reduced, lower, higher, diminished, or elevated IN a disease/patient group,
do NOT emit `MEASURE reduces DISEASE` or `MEASURE increases DISEASE`.

Those sentences mean the MEASURE differs by disease/status. Use:
- `MEASURE is_biomarker_of DISEASE` when the disease/status is the endpoint.
- `MEASURE distinguishes DISEASE_OR_GROUP` when the sentence explicitly compares
  groups or diagnostic classes.
- `MEASURE correlates_with OUTCOME` when the endpoint is severity, survival,
  score, performance, or another continuous clinical/cognitive outcome.

Bad examples — DO NOT emit:
- subject="microscopic fractional anisotropy", predicate="reduces", object="temporal lobe epilepsy"
- subject="nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding", predicate="reduces", object="Alzheimer disease"
- subject="right hippocampal volume", predicate="reduces", object="Alzheimer disease"
- subject="regional cerebral blood flow", predicate="reduces", object="severity of dementia"

Correct examples:
- Text: "Microscopic fractional anisotropy was reduced in TLE patients."
  Claim: subject="microscopic fractional anisotropy", predicate="is_biomarker_of",
  object="temporal lobe epilepsy"
- Text: "Regional cerebral blood flow was lower and related to dementia severity."
  Claim: subject="regional cerebral blood flow", predicate="correlates_with",
  object="severity of dementia"
- Text: "Hippocampal volume was reduced in Alzheimer disease compared with controls."
  Claim: subject="hippocampal volume", predicate="distinguishes",
  object="Alzheimer disease"

Transdiagnostic / meta-analysis neuroimaging results — IMPORTANT:
Large consortium, ENIGMA, meta-analysis, mega-analysis, multi-site, and cross-disorder
abstracts often report valid biomedical claims as group contrasts, effect sizes,
shared profiles, or moderator associations. These ARE claims when a concrete imaging
measurement is named.

Extract these claim types:
- Group contrast: if a concrete imaging measurement is thinner, smaller, larger,
  lower, higher, altered, abnormal, or different in a disorder/patient group compared
  with controls or another disorder, use `distinguishes`.
- Cross-disorder/shared profile: if the same imaging measurement/profile is shared
  across multiple psychiatric disorders, use `is_associated_with` or `distinguishes`
  with object "multiple psychiatric disorders", "psychiatric disorders", or the
  explicitly named disorder set.
- Symptom/dimension association: if a concrete imaging measurement, normative
  deviation, connectivity measure, or cortical/subcortical measure correlates with
  psychopathology dimensions, symptom severity, illness duration, age at onset,
  medication dose, cognitive performance, or functional outcome, use `correlates_with`
  unless the abstract says it predicts a future outcome.
  Use the imaging measurement as subject and the clinical/demographic moderator as
  object. For example, "age correlated with temporal pole thickness" should be
  subject="temporal pole cortical thickness", object="age", not subject="age".
- Normative model deviations are valid imaging markers when they are tied to a
  concrete brain measurement (e.g. "cortical volume normative deviation").
- Keep one claim per biological finding. Do NOT split one reported bilateral or
  left/right effect into duplicate claims unless the abstract gives different
  directions or different biological interpretations for each side.
- Do NOT extract explicit null findings ("no differences", "not associated",
  "did not predict", "no significant effect") as positive claims. Return no claim
  for that result unless the abstract's main contribution is specifically a
  negative association and you set `negated=true`.

Good Case Study 1 examples:
- Text: "Individuals with schizophrenia showed widespread thinner cortex and smaller
  surface area compared with controls, with largest effects in frontal and temporal
  regions."
  Claims:
  subject="cortical thickness", predicate="distinguishes", object="schizophrenia",
  effect_size="-0.530/-0.516 if reported", direction="bilaterally reduced in schizophrenia"
  subject="cortical surface area", predicate="distinguishes", object="schizophrenia",
  effect_size="-0.251/-0.254 if reported", direction="bilaterally reduced in schizophrenia"
- Text: "Regional cortical thickness was negatively correlated with medication dose,
  symptom severity, and duration of illness."
  Claims:
  subject="regional cortical thickness", predicate="correlates_with",
  object="medication dose"
  subject="regional cortical thickness", predicate="correlates_with",
  object="symptom severity"
  subject="regional cortical thickness", predicate="correlates_with",
  object="duration of illness"
- Text: "Adults with bipolar disorder had thinner frontal, temporal, and parietal
  cortices."
  Claim: subject="frontal, temporal, and parietal cortical thickness",
  predicate="distinguishes", object="bipolar disorder", direction="reduced in bipolar disorder"
- Text: "Normative deviations in cortical volume explained transdiagnostic dimensions
  of psychopathology better than raw cortical volume."
  Claim: subject="cortical volume normative deviation", predicate="predicts" or
  "correlates_with", object="transdiagnostic psychopathology dimensions"
- Text: "A shared cortical thickness profile across six psychiatric disorders was
  associated with pyramidal-cell gene expression."
  Claim: subject="shared cortical thickness profile", predicate="is_associated_with",
  object="multiple psychiatric disorders"

Do NOT skip a sentence just because it is from a meta-analysis or consortium paper.
Do NOT use "meta-analysis", "ENIGMA", "multi-site sample", "classifier", or the
statistical model as subject/object; put those in `methodology` or `population`.

Method/procedure handling — IMPORTANT:
Methods, algorithms, pipelines, classifiers, registration/segmentation procedures,
software tools, statistical models, and validation protocols are NOT biomedical
entities for `subject` or `object`. Put them in `methodology` instead.

When a sentence has the form "Using METHOD, we found MEASURE/MARKER relates to
DISEASE/OUTCOME", extract the real MEASURE/MARKER as the subject/object and store
METHOD in `methodology`.

Good examples:
- Text: "Using fluid registration, patients with Alzheimer disease showed faster
  hippocampal atrophy."
  Claim: subject="hippocampal atrophy", predicate="is_biomarker_of" or "distinguishes",
  object="Alzheimer disease", methodology="fluid registration"
- Text: "Manual segmentation showed reduced hippocampal volume in Alzheimer disease."
  Claim: subject="hippocampal volume", predicate="reduces" or "is_biomarker_of",
  object="Alzheimer disease", methodology="manual segmentation"
- Text: "A support vector machine using cortical thickness distinguished MCI converters
  from non-converters."
  Claim: subject="cortical thickness", predicate="distinguishes", object="MCI conversion",
  methodology="support vector machine"

Bad examples — DO NOT emit claims like these:
- subject="fluid registration", predicate="is_biomarker_of", object="Alzheimer disease"
- subject="manual segmentation", predicate="has_adverse_effect", object="hippocampal volume"
- subject="classifier", predicate="predicts", object="conversion"
- subject="fully deformable registration methods", predicate="increases",
  object="agreement between automated segmentations and expert manual segmentations"
- subject="symmetric image normalization method (SyN)", predicate="distinguishes",
  object="frontotemporal dementia"
- subject="spatial distribution analysis techniques", predicate="predicts",
  object="classification of 3D medical images"
- subject="neuroimaging methods", predicate="distinguishes", object="Alzheimer disease"
- subject="neuropsychological test battery", predicate="predicts", object="Alzheimer disease"

If the abstract only evaluates a method/procedure itself (e.g. reproducibility,
accuracy, registration error, segmentation reliability) and does NOT state a biomedical
marker-disease/outcome relationship, return no claim for that sentence rather than
guessing a biomarker.

Method-validation endpoints such as "scan-rescan consistency", "volume repeatability",
"segmentation reproducibility", "registration error", "measurement accuracy", "gold
standard comparison", "inter-rater reliability", "agreement with manual tracing",
"classification accuracy", "sensitivity/specificity of a diagnostic test", "effect
size", and "required sample size" are method-performance outcomes, not disease
biomarkers. Do NOT emit them as subject/object biomedical entities.
Do NOT turn an objective sentence like "to validate METHOD for measuring MARKER in
DISEASE" into a biomarker claim unless the abstract reports an actual disease/outcome
finding for MARKER.
The `raw_sentence` must explicitly support BOTH endpoints and the predicate. A disease
cohort mentioned only in the sample description (e.g. "15 controls and 12 Alzheimer
disease patients") is not enough. Do NOT infer "MARKER reduces in DISEASE" from a
method-comparison sentence unless the sentence says the marker is reduced, increased,
different, predictive, diagnostic, or associated with the disease/outcome.

Generic imaging/test labels are not concrete biomarkers. Do NOT use broad labels such
as "brain imaging", "structural imaging", "functional imaging", "neuroimaging
techniques", "magnetic resonance scans", "serial MRI scans", "imaging biomarkers",
"test battery", or "diagnostic test sensitivity" as subject/object biomedical
entities. If a concrete score or measurement is named, extract that instead; examples
that can be valid are "clock drawing test score", "episodic memory test performance",
"white matter hyperintensity volume", "amyloid PET SUVR", and "hippocampal atrophy".

Pure imaging modality names are methods, not biomarkers. Do NOT use CT, computed
tomography, PET, positron emission tomography, FDG-PET, amyloid PET, SPECT,
single-photon emission tomography, single photon emission tomography,
single-photon emission computed tomography, single photon emission computed
tomography, MRI, magnetic resonance imaging, structural MRI, structural magnetic
resonance imaging, fMRI, functional MRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging,
DTI, diffusion tensor imaging, diffusion MRI, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging,
EEG, electroencephalography, MEG, or magnetoencephalography as the subject of
`is_biomarker_of`, `predicts`, or `distinguishes`.

Instead, extract the concrete measurement produced by the modality when the abstract
states one. Good subjects include "FDG hypometabolism", "amyloid PET SUVR",
"entorhinal cortical thickness", "hippocampal volume", "fractional anisotropy",
"functional connectivity", "regional cerebral blood flow", or "dopamine transporter
binding". Put the modality itself in `methodology`.

Bad examples — DO NOT emit:
- subject="computed tomography", predicate="is_biomarker_of", object="reversible causes of dementia"
- subject="positron emission tomography", predicate="is_biomarker_of", object="memory function"
- subject="functional magnetic resonance imaging", predicate="predicts", object="Alzheimer disease"
- subject="single-photon emission tomography scanning", predicate="distinguishes", object="Alzheimer disease"
- subject="APOE", predicate="distinguishes", object="quantitative MRI measurements"
- subject="this technique", predicate="predicts", object="Alzheimer disease"

Real error examples from neuroimaging review abstracts — these sentences describe
modalities or literature focus, not concrete biomarker findings. Return NO CLAIM
for these sentences unless a concrete measurement is named:
- Text: "Computed tomography is still used to determine reversible causes of dementia."
  Wrong: subject="computed tomography", predicate="is_biomarker_of",
  object="reversible causes of dementia"
  Correct: no claim.
- Text: "Of the new techniques, functional magnetic resonance imaging seems the most promising."
  Wrong: subject="functional magnetic resonance imaging", predicate="predicts",
  object="Alzheimer disease"
  Correct: no claim.
- Text: "This technique can possibly play a role in predicting Alzheimer's disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment."
  Wrong: subject="functional magnetic resonance imaging", predicate="predicts",
  object="Alzheimer disease"
  Correct: no claim, because "this technique" refers to a modality and no concrete
  measurement is named.
- Text: "The use of single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission
  tomography in early differential diagnoses seems limited."
  Wrong: subject="single-photon emission computed tomography", predicate="distinguishes",
  object="early differential diagnoses"
  Correct: no claim.
- Text: "Current and future positron emission tomography studies concentrate on memory
  function and receptor imaging."
  Wrong: subject="positron emission tomography", predicate="predicts",
  object="memory function"
  Correct: no claim.
