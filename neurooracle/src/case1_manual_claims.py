"""Manual Case Study 1 claim curation for transdiagnostic neuroimaging papers.

This module is intentionally LLM-free. It converts hand-reviewed PubMed
abstract findings into the same Claim objects used by Phase 2 extraction, so
the downstream ingestion, entity resolution, deduplication, and graph edge
generation stay identical to automatic extraction.
