## 📖 Overview

**NeuroDiscovery** is a closed-loop framework for evidence-grounded neuroimaging autoresearch. It comprises a **neuroscience knowledge graph**, a **hypothesis generator** and **NeuroRuntime**, an agent-based execution platform.

The graph combines curated resources with source-linked literature evidence, preserving provenance, publication dates and evidence polarity. The generator constructs testable cross-domain hypotheses compatible with available data and analysis methods. NeuroRuntime tests selected hypotheses reproducibly on raw neuroimaging data; supported, contradicted and inconclusive outcomes guide subsequent research, separately from execution failures.

NeuroRuntime retains the project's strengths in **neuroimaging dataset and model adaptation**, **data processing** and **model configuration/execution**. It ships with independent GUI and CLI interfaces for day-to-day use, and can also be installed as a reusable skill library inside agent projects such as OpenClaw, Hermes, and Claude Code.

### NeuroDiscovery and research materials

This repository hosts **NeuroDiscovery** (formerly **NeuroClaw**) and related public resources. Existing directory and interface names, including `neurooracle/`, `neurobench/`, `neuroclaw_environment.json`, the `neuroclaw` host-agent skill and `neuroclaw_academic_*` MCP tools, are retained for compatibility.

Public materials have separate versions:

| Resource | Availability |
| --- | --- |
| Neuroimaging execution tasks | **500 task definitions**, T01–T500, with a complete seven-category [task registry](neurobench/task_atlas.json). See the [benchmark README](neurobench/README.md). |
| Knowledge-graph explorer | The [NeuroOracle demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zxcvb20001/NeuroOracle) provides interactive graph exploration. Its loaded snapshot can differ from the research graph. See the [graph version notes](materials/huggingface/NeuroOracle/README.md#graph-versions). |
| Benchmark outputs | [Selected historical evaluation outputs](materials/benchmark_results/README.md) are available. Their task coverage is recorded per run. |
| NeuroDiscovery manuscript release | The frozen graph, paper-specific evaluation outputs and figure source data are being prepared for a versioned research release. A release identifier and artifact manifest will be linked here when available. |

The linked [NeuroClaw technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.24696) describes an earlier project version. Its experiments and the public demo should be interpreted using their own version information, separately from the NeuroDiscovery manuscript.

- **Paper Writing**: Auto-generated drafts, format standardization

### 🤝 Flexible Integration
- **NeuroDiscovery provides standalone GUI and CLI workflows through NeuroRuntime**, so researchers can use it directly without depending on another host project.
- `skills/`, `materials/`, `USER.md`, and `SOUL.md` can also be installed as a reusable skill library in existing agent systems such as OpenClaw, Hermes, and Claude Code.
- The bundled `core/` engine provides an integrated agent loop, skill loader, and tool runtime for standalone deployments.
- Non-neuroscience connectors (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, calendar, e-commerce, SaaS auth)
  are disabled by default via `core/config/features.json` and can be re-enabled if needed.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1. Desktop Client (recommended)

Download the latest Windows or macOS client from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/NeuroDiscovery/releases). Existing release assets retain their original NeuroClaw filenames.

- **Windows:** use `NeuroClaw Setup 0.2.1.exe` for normal installation. The portable `.exe` is also available, but may take longer to start because it extracts the app first.
- **macOS:** use the `.dmg` or `.zip` build from the release assets.
- Open **Settings** to configure the model endpoint, runtime mode, Python path, FSL path, proxy, language, and text size.
- Open **NeuroOracle** from the sidebar. If the graph file is missing, the client can download it from Hugging Face.

Linux remains supported through the source repository, command-line workflow, and web interface.

### Option 2. Run from Source

Requirements: Python >= 3.10 and Git. Conda/Mamba, CUDA/GPU tools, FSL, FreeSurfer, and dcm2niix are optional depending on the workflows you want to run.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/NeuroDiscovery.git
cd NeuroDiscovery
python installer/setup.py
python core/agent/main.py --web
```

Then open **http://localhost:7080** in your browser.

Useful checks:

```bash
python installer/setup.py --check
python core/agent/main.py --web --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0
```

Settings are saved to `neuroclaw_environment.json`. API keys can be passed at runtime with `--api-key` or provided through the configured provider environment variable.

### Option 3. Install as a Host-Agent Skill

Use this path if you want Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or another coding agent to use NeuroDiscovery's neuroimaging skill library.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/NeuroDiscovery.git
cd NeuroDiscovery
python installer/install_agent_integration.py --target codex
```

Common targets:

| Host agent | Install command |
|---|---|
| Codex | `python installer/install_agent_integration.py --target codex` |
| Claude Code | `python installer/install_agent_integration.py --target claude-code` |
| Cursor | `python installer/install_agent_integration.py --target cursor --scope project` |
| Multiple agents | `python installer/install_agent_integration.py --target all` |

The installed host-agent skill retains its compatibility name, `neuroclaw`. After installation, ask the host agent to **use NeuroClaw** or **enter NeuroClaw mode** for neuroimaging, NeuroOracle, NeuroBench, and autoresearch tasks.

</div>

> Benchmark output files under `materials/benchmark_results/` are historical run artifacts. See their [coverage and scoring notes](materials/benchmark_results/README.md) before comparing them with a newer task registry.

### Benchmark Evaluation

The 500 neuroimaging execution tasks live under `neurobench/`. Each task directory contains a `task.md` instruction file, and [task_atlas.json](neurobench/task_atlas.json) assigns every task to one of seven categories. NeuroBench remains the name used by the existing benchmark interface.

NeuroBench currently accepts these benchmark configurations:
- `with-skills`: the agent can use the skills loaded from `skills/`
- `no-skills`: the baseline run without skills
- `with-skills` + `no-skills` paired comparison: enable `--benchmark-compare-skills` to run both variants for the same task set

Benchmark scoring is handled separately with `--score-benchmark`: it reads reports in `output/`, applies a GPT-5.4 weighted rubric, and generates numeric scores for planning completeness, tool/skill reasonableness, and command/code correctness. For fairness, each task case is scored in one batch across all comparable models to reduce scoring-standard drift. Skill-call counts are recorded separately and used for efficiency analysis.

To score existing benchmark reports:
```bash
python core/agent/main.py --score-benchmark
```

To speed up scoring on larger runs:
```bash
python core/agent/main.py --score-benchmark --score-workers 8
```

**Web benchmark mode**
```bash
python core/agent/main.py --web --benchmark
```

**CLI benchmark batch runner**
```bash
python core/agent/main.py --benchmark
```

To run the paired skill comparison in CLI mode:
```bash
python core/agent/main.py --benchmark --benchmark-compare-skills
```

In CLI benchmark mode, NeuroRuntime will ask for:
- the benchmark directory path
- the benchmark model name

Then it will:
- read all `task.md` files recursively from that directory
- sort tasks alphabetically by task folder name
- run tasks one by one without asking for intermediate confirmation
- print progress in the terminal only
- save reports under `output/<model_name>/`, with one markdown report per case and run

The benchmark reports include the solution thinking, skills used, skill-call counts, and the commands or code that were used or suggested.
